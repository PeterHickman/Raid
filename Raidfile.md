# Welcome to `raid`

This file documents the various tasks that I find useful (for demonstrating how a `Raidfile.md` works)

Note that the level one heading above and this plain text are being ignored. Allowing you to add documentation for the tasks within the file

> This quote is ignored because there is no preceding level two heading

And this will also be ignored

```bash
echo "Bad things can happen"
```

## hello

> A programming classic in Ruby

```ruby
puts "Hello world"
```

## df

> What free space do we have on /

```bash
df -h /
```

## add

> Add some numbers in javascript

We define part of the script here:

```js
var a = 12;
var b = 13;
```

And then define the rest here. Note that we have to restate the source, `js`, and the application will error if it changes

```js
print(a + b)
```

## echo

> Try and echo the command line arguments

```ruby
puts "There are #{ARGV.size} arguments: #{ARGV.inspect}"
```
