# Raid

I saw this really cool idea called `maid`, a Rake like tool that uses Markdown files to document and implement the tasks and how to do them. Go check it out at https://github.com/egoist/maid

It uses `npm` to install. Not wanting to install a bazzilion unverified dependencies I asked myself "How hard can this be?"

So here we are then

Requires a lot more work but I will pick on it from time to time

# TODO

0. Pass arguments to the tasks
0. Document stuff
